# Greenity (Work In Progress)

Greenity is my community development project which is a blog platform that combine technology with sustainable development. It allows users, students or individuals who want to explore, read and learn about the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and engage with ideas that promote inclusive and eco-conscious community growth.

## What problem it solves

Many individuals and communities want to take part in sustainable development but lack access to clear, engaging, and organized resources. Greenity solves this by offering a user-friendly platform to explore SDG-related content, learn from real-world examples, and take action with knowledge.
